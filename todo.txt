# todo: insert parameter vars in solve before solving
# todo: should there be a recursive check for param var? loop is also a param var
    # is a loop var not always a param var?
    
# todo: finish newton-raphson 
# todo: finish blocking
# todo: jacobian on incidence matrix
# todo: avoid having to compare with unused vars in solve func
# todo: multi process on solving grids

# todo: add save/load etc
# todo: add settings button for solver
# todo: temp fix loop_var_eqs system in update eqsys and solve

# todo: add rules for syntax highlighting for eq window and python window
# todo: perhaps add a system which checks ex: if param var and loop var: throw error.
# todo: make show blocks show the equation and the equation number

# todo: pot bug: what happens if we have an eq gen whick makes a var*0? can we get eq!=vars situation then?
# todo: fix double imports
# todo: it now _sync_eqs first, check that it doesnt cause any bugs syncing before vars
# todo: bug what to do if param and loop var defined at the same time? a = 5, a = loopvar[]
# todo: check for var name already existing in namespace when syncing
# todo: bug if inputting var in python window which is already created as var object: x=10 ex
# todo: bug: a,b,c, a and c is loop vars but c = a,b. still gets included in block, should thrown an error during blocking
    # fix?: each block must contain equal numbers of var and eqs
# todo: Plotting
# todo: find another solution instead of passing around the global namespace
# todo: clean eq sys functions
# todo: allow for different solvers based on block size
